The RESTful API I made is here: https://github.com/frankymz/databaseAPI. View the Service.js file here in the src/API folder to see how these were implemented. 

The project is not yet meant to be ran from another device as the data on MySQL Workbench is not accessible remotely as of now.

The client side project structure is a Pages folder and a Components folder inside of src.
